\# Graph Algorithms Practice (DFS \& BFS)



This repository contains my practice implementations of fundamental graph algorithms using C++ and STL.



The goal of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills in Graph Theory, especially focusing on Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).

\## 📚 Problems Implemented



\### 1️⃣ Edge Checker

Checks whether a directed edge exists between two nodes using adjacency list representation.



File: edge\_checker.cpp



---



\### 2️⃣ Neighbor Finder

Finds and prints neighbors of a node in descending order.



File: neighbor\_finder.cpp



---



\### 3️⃣ Path Finder (BFS - Grid)

Determines whether a path exists between 'A' and 'B' in a grid using BFS traversal.



File: path\_finder\_bfs.cpp



---



\### 4️⃣ Connected Components Counter (Grid)

Counts total connected components in a grid using DFS.



File: connected\_components.cpp



---



\### 5️⃣ Component Sizes (Grid)

Finds and prints the sizes of connected regions in a grid using DFS.



File: component\_sizes.cpp
